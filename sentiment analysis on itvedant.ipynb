Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.33      0.33      0.33         3\n","           1       0.96      0.96      0.96        54\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.93        57\n","   macro avg       0.65      0.65      0.65        57\n","weighted avg       0.93      0.93      0.93        57\n","\n"]}],"source":["y_hat = model.predict(seq_padded_test)\n","y_hat = np.where(y_hat\u003e=0.5, 1, 0)\n","print(classification_report(y_test, y_hat))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"HhE9Ca7oHOEy"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"w4wbUxQPHOBV"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"TXWT88UBHN87"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"TGTh-3ggHN1z"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"odxwXK0mHNx-"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNTCO6jwy/Tt86vtS/J+Fcf","mount_file_id":"1FjMQux9s0KCDe9IXpkoNSZNGrNUWrlL_","name":"sentiment analysis on itvedant.ipynb","version":""},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
